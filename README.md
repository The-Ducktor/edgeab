> edgeab is a free and open-source Python app that easily creates a full-featured audiobook from an EPUB or text file using realistic text-to-speech from [Edge-TTS](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts/).

> Note: This project is a semi-remake of [epub2tts-edge](https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-edge), but it's optimized for my use case, running approximately 8x faster (or at a minimum 4-5x) and using calibre for metadata.

* Generally takes about 10 minutes for the light novels I've tested this on from start to finished file.

## ðŸš€ Features

- [x] Creates standard format M4B audiobook file
- [x] Automatic chapter break detection
- [x] Embeds cover art if specified (crops image to square)
- [x] Utilizes Microsoft Edge for free cloud-based TTS
- [x] Reads sentences in parallel for extremely fast audiobook creation (approximately 10x faster than [epub2tts-edge](https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-edge))
- [x] Resumes from the last point if interrupted (kind of)
- [x] Embeds all the fun metadata pulled from a calibre opf file

**Note:** EPUB file must be DRM-free

## ðŸ“– Usage

Convert EPUB to formatted TXT file:

```bash
edgeab -f "epubfile"

Alternatively, use [epub2tts-edge](https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-edge):

```
